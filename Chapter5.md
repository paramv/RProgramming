# Subsetting 1
Same as selecting or extracting data.

* "-" is same as negation.
* subsetting a list returns another list
	* ex l <- list(one=c(1,2),TRUE,c('hello','world'))
	* then l[1] is also a list
* to get the actual  list element use the double bracket or name reference
	* l1 = l[[1]] or l1 = l$one
