# Data Structures and Types

## Datastructures
* Vectors, matrices and arrays
	* vectors - 1D
	* matrix - 2D
	* array - ND
* Create vectors with c(1,2,3,4)
* Create matrix with matrix(vector) or matrx(vector,row=2)
* Create array with array(vector,dim=vector) where dim is a vector with the number of dimensions
* vec * vec multiplies each element with corresponding element
* vec %*% vec does inner multiplication i.e., returns a single value
* vec %o% vec does outer multiplication i.e., returns a matrix

## Data Types
* factor, character strings (text), logical and number
* use `class` function to identify datatype
* "+" is not overloaded. Only math
* T and F are same as TRUE and FALSE
* `factor` categorical data. Similar to maps
